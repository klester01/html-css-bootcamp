## DC Blog
James, this is my initial try on the DC Blog, I need to make some updates based on what I recently learned in class. Please review and provide any feedback 
## DgtlCrfts

James, this is my initial try on the DgtlCrfts. I am figuring things out. Do I need to create a box for the toolbox at the bottom? I also may need help with centering things and sizing my borders and padding.

James, I have not started this assignent yet 

This design is the hardest of the three. The navigation panel on the left should be fixed to the screen, and only the right side of the page should scroll. You can try to look at http://underscorejs.org/ to see how they implemented this design.

HTML Tags you might use:
- &lt;img /> for the DigitalCrafts logo
- &lt;a>&lt;/a>, &lt;ul>&lt;/ul>, and &lt;li>&lt;/li> for the sidebar navigation
- &lt;input /> for the search bar (you can use an attribute called "placeholder" )
- A &lt;div> or &lt;span> with a background image for the down arrow

CSS you might use:
- float: left; (to stack the sidebar and main content horizontally)
- the :hover selector to make links highlight when you hover over them
- border-left: 5px; (for the left side of the quote box)
- height: 100vw; and width:300px;  combined with position: fixed; for the side bar
